    <h1 class="one"> Our Story </h1>
    <p class="p_3">Welcome to Scented Sojourn, where every candle tells a story of passion, creativity, and dedication. Our journey began in 2024, when our founder, Zobia Ali, discovered a deep love for the art of candle making. What started as a hobby quickly blossomed into a full-fledged business, driven by a desire to create something truly special.</p>
        <p class="p_3"><b>The Spark of Inspiration</b>

            The inspiration for Scented Sojourn came from a simple yet profound moment. Zobia Ali was searching for a way to bring warmth and tranquility into their home. After experimenting with different scents and designs, they realized the transformative power of a beautifully crafted candle. This realization ignited a passion to share this magic with others.
